While thinking computationally is a prerequisite for programming, programming and computational thinking are not the same thing.

Computers are precise, and computing instructions must be clear and unambiguous, as the computer cannot think - it can only follow orders. Luckily, computers work very quickly. Unlike humans, they do not get bored or distracted, and will carry out the same tedious, repetitive tasks over and over again without making mistakes.

#### Computational thinking in our daily lives

Subconsciously, we practise computational thinking every day of our lives. As Jeannette Wing stated: 

*"Computational thinking describes the mental activity in formulating a problem to admit a computational solution. **The solution can be carried out by a human or machine**."*

Every time we need to plan to do something, we use some of the steps of computational thinking such as problem breakdown, pattern recognition and developing algorithms. 

- Project managers use computational thinking to plan complex activities. 

- Epidemiologists use it to identify patterns to predict how a disease outbreak will spread. 

- Parents use it to juggle work, parenting, community responsibilities and housework.

#### Breaking problems down

When trying to solve problems, it is essential to break them down into their constituent parts. 

Pasting sticky notes on a wall, or creating a structure diagram on a whiteboard can both help to visualise the necessary steps. 

#### Structure diagrams

Structure diagrams allow you to plan problem breakdown visually. At the top should be the objective, and the steps underneath should start with high level considerations. These high level considerations can then be broken down into smaller and smaller steps.

In the example below, a group of four people have survived a major nuclear accident. They do not know how many other people might have survived, or what kinds of conditions they are facing. They have to work out how they are going to survive. The diagram is the start of their thinking about their immediate needs.

### Practice

Imagine you have invited three friends to your house for lunch. Draw a structure diagram of all the things you would need to consider in your plan to make this happen, such as location, seating, recipes, drinks, table settings and so on.
